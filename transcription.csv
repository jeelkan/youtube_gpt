0,Build an Agenda with Decisions," Hi there! It's Angela from Decisions. Here to help you make your meetings the most productive part of your day. By now, you should have downloaded the Decisions app. If you haven't and you need assistance, please see our Getting Started with Decisions video. If you've downloaded the app and you are looking to make your first agenda, you've come to the right place. First, you'll want to click on the Decisions icon and Teams. Your calendar will pop up and you'll see two tabs for your meetings, upcoming and past. This page includes all the meetings you have organized or been invited to. Later, once you add agendas to your meetings, you'll be able to search for the meetings here. To create your first agenda, choose the meeting you like to get started on and click on it. You'll be prompted to choose a team to associate your meeting with or you can store your meeting information on your personal one drive. However, we suggest selecting a team or group as it gives you a richer set of features for collaboration and content sharing. After you choose your team, you'll be prompted to choose a channel. Select your channel and your agenda builder will appear. And here's where all the magic happens. Title your first agenda item here and add all the relevant components you'd like to build up. This may include allocated time for the agenda item, any speakers or leaders for that section, a description, any associated materials like PDFs, word documents that you can upload and attach directly to the agenda item, as well as ways to categorize and sort relevant agenda sections. Let's explore each one of these options. Start by choosing an exact amount of time for your agenda item. When you later conduct your meeting, decision smart time tracker will run alongside your agenda alerting you to when the time for that section is almost up, keeping the meeting on pace and on topic. To add presenters or collaborators to an agenda item, click on the person icon and choose who you would like to assign from your team. These users will also be able to edit and add content to their agenda items. Next, fill out your agenda item with a detailed description. You can change the font, format, and other content here. Additionally, you can attach relevant documents to the agenda item by uploading or dragging files here. You can attach photos, word documents, PDFs, PowerPoints, and more. I'm going to add this PDF over a report we are working on. You can also embed images right into the agenda item like this graph I'm adding. To track topics across agendas, add a hashtag here to quickly identify the topic for the agenda item and be able to quickly look up all agenda items with that tag across your meeting agendas. And this drop down menu allows you to communicate to the participants what type of agenda item this is to provide information, have a discussion, or make a decision. Now your first agenda item is ready to go and you can start building out the rest. At this point, you'll need to save. I'm going to save it as a draft so I can keep working on it without publishing it to the attendees. Now, I'll quickly show you how to add a second agenda item. If you filled out all your agenda items, you're ready to notify the attendees that the agenda is available. Even after publishing, don't worry. You can always go back and edit your agenda items by clicking on the pencil icon or adding more items to your agenda by clicking on the add button. Once your agenda is ready to send out to your guests, notify them by publishing the agenda here. There are many options on how you can notify attendees which you can choose here. Congratulations! You just made your first decisions agenda and you're well on your way to creating great meeting culture for your organization. Thanks for watching. As always, please check out our support articles if you have any further questions and browse through the rest of our video library to learn more about how to use decisions. See you again soon."
