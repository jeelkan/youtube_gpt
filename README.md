# YouTube GPT ðŸ¤–

YouTube GPT is a cutting-edge application that brings the power of AI-driven conversation to YouTube videos. It allows users to interact with video content in a novel way by asking questions and receiving answers based on the video's transcription. Utilizing OpenAI's Whisper for accurate transcriptions and GPT-3 for generating conversational responses, YouTube GPT offers a unique way to engage with video content.

## How It Works

1. **Transcription**: The application first downloads the audio from a specified YouTube video and uses OpenAI Whisper to generate a text transcription.
2. **Interaction**: Users can then ask questions related to the video's content. The application uses GPT-3.5-turbo to understand the question within the context of the transcription and generate relevant answers.
3. **Insights**: Beyond simple Q&A, YouTube GPT can summarize the video, offering quick insights and takeaways without watching the entire content.
